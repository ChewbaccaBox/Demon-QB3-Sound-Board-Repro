# Demon-QB3-Sound-Board

** UNTESTED AND POSSIBLY INCOMPLETE **
Gerbers not included because of this.

Here is my reproduction sound board of those
used in Rockola's Demon and QB3, both based
on Cinematronics hardware. 
So, these games are both impossible to find,
and therefore the sound boards are too.
Demon uses practically a standard Cinematronics
CPU board, and QB3 is a bit more complicated
to make hardware for, but this sound board
should work for the two games.
(QB3 has more ram, a color converter PCB, the sound roms
 dumped are broken. But Demon should work with less trouble!)


**TESTING STATUS:**

no clue! gotta double check the schematic based on the original.
This is being built on solely the two schematics (the QB3 one 
looks more accurate/complete, so leaning towards that one)
